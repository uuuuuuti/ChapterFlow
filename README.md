# ChapterFlow · 文织·网文工坊

从一个想法，到一部长篇。基于 [NarraLume](https://github.com/abligail/narralume) 的中文网文创作工作台，保留原长篇引擎与 Apache-2.0 许可证。

当前工作树已经把 Phase 0 → Phase 1 → Phase 2 → Phase 4 的核心主链迁入 ChapterFlow，并继续推进 M0—M9：作品管理、创作首页、原生大纲、三栏写作台、设定、自动保存、版本、AI 建议采纳、选区改写、任务恢复、网文规划、手工数据复盘、发布导出和备份恢复。完整缺口、旧入口清单和 Luna Max Goal 执行顺序见 [完整改造缺口与执行方案](docs/refactor/10-comprehensive-gap-plan.md)、[全平台迁移方案](docs/refactor/06-full-platform-migration-plan.md)、[当前缺口审计](docs/refactor/08-current-gap-audit.md)、[迁移台账](docs/refactor/MIGRATION_MATRIX.md) 与 [Luna Max 执行台账](docs/refactor/09-luna-max-execution-backlog.md)；可直接复制的 Goal 提示词见 [07-luna-goal-prompt.md](docs/refactor/07-luna-goal-prompt.md)。

## 本地启动

使用 Node.js 24 LTS（24.15+）或更新的受支持版本，以及 npm 11+。

```sh
npm ci
npm run build
npm run dev
```

打开 [ChapterFlow](http://127.0.0.1:4318/books)。服务端为 4317，前端为 4318。手工建书、写作、保存、版本与导出无需配置 AI；使用 AI 前，在设置中添加模型服务与写作模型。

数据默认保存在 `data/` 中；浏览器本地模式的数据位于当前浏览器，请通过设置备份。不要把开发目录中的数据库提交到 Git。

## 验证

```sh
npm run verify
npm run test:e2e
CHAPTERFLOW_E2E_SUCCESS_MODEL=1 npm run test:e2e -- e2e/chapterflow.spec.ts e2e/chapterflow-ai.spec.ts e2e/chapterflow-resilience.spec.ts
```

最后一条使用仅测试环境启用的确定性 AI，验证完整候选采纳流程，不会调用真实付费模型。原上游故障模型与对应恢复测试保持独立。

新入口统一为 `/books/*`、`/settings/*`；`/shelf`、`/projects/:projectId/*` 和历史 `/books/:id/{overview,bible,studio,runs,lab,delivery}` 只作为保留上下文的兼容深链，不作为普通导航入口。发布保持导出后由作者手工上传，不接入第三方自动登录或自动发布。

The hard part of a novel is rarely generating the next paragraph. It is keeping characters, chronology, promises, outline decisions, and tens of thousands of existing words in agreement. A change may affect several chapters, and an AI suggestion should not become part of the book simply because it was generated.

NarraLume keeps that work in one writing environment. You can maintain structured story material, write by hand, save versions, annotate and review a chapter, or delegate a selection, one chapter, or a continuous run to an AI model. Generated prose, revisions, and story changes remain candidates until the author accepts them.

It is a complete manual writing tool first and an AI-assisted tool second. Creating books, importing manuscripts, organizing the story, writing, exporting, and backing up do not require a model. The interface supports both Chinese and English; you can switch it at any time under Settings → Interface language.

## How it approaches long-form writing

| Principle                                          | NarraLume's approach                                                                                                                                   |
| -------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Story knowledge should not live in scattered chats | Author intent, outline, entities, canon facts, relationships, timeline events, and foreshadowing live in one story bible shared by writing and review. |
| An AI suggestion is not a saved decision           | Prose, revisions, and story changes are staged as candidates that the author can compare, accept, reject, or keep for later.                           |
| A long task should survive navigation and failure  | AI work has steps, states, checkpoints, and run records. The author can leave a page and return from the overview or run center.                       |
| A manuscript must be portable and recoverable      | Delivery formats, single-project bundles, project snapshots, and full SQLite backups are separate tools with explicit recovery boundaries.             |

These constraints make AI behave more like a collaborator who submits reviewable work than a chat box that can silently replace the current draft.

## From an idea to a deliverable manuscript

1. **Create or import a book.** Begin from a blank project, let AI organize an initial direction, or import Markdown, plain text, DOCX, HTML, EPUB, or a NarraLume project bundle.
2. **State the author's intent.** Record the reading promise, themes, audience, tone, ending direction, current focus, and boundaries that planning and review should respect.
3. **Build the story bible.** Organize volumes, chapters, scenes, entities, confirmed facts, relationships, chronology, and foreshadowing.
4. **Write in the studio.** Edit Markdown manually, save versions and comments, request a selection edit, or delegate a chapter.
5. **Review and revise.** Inspect findings with evidence, accept or reject them, mark false positives, and create revision candidates when useful.
6. **Decide story changes.** New character states, facts, relationships, timeline events, and foreshadowing do not enter canon silently. A conflict with a locked fact pauses the task for an author decision.
7. **Deliver and preserve.** Review quality reminders, export the manuscript, create a project snapshot, and make a full-library backup before upgrades or migration.

```text
idea or existing manuscript
  -> author intent, story bible, and outline
  -> manual writing / selection edit / chapter delegation / continuous writing
  -> review findings and story-change candidates
  -> author decision
  -> saved version, export, and backup
```

### Bookshelf

The bookshelf is where books begin: start from a blank project, let the AI guide creation, or import an existing manuscript. Covers are customizable, and deleted books stay in a recycle bin for 30 days.

<p><img src="assets/narralume-shelf-1920x1080.png" alt="The NarraLume bookshelf with a custom book cover" width="1440"></p>

### Writing studio

The studio keeps chapters, prose, versions, and review tools on one screen: structure on the left, writing in the middle, and review findings or story-change candidates handled right beside them, without jumping to another tool. AI output always lands as a candidate first and enters the manuscript only after the author accepts it.

<p><img src="assets/narralume-studio-1920x1080.png" alt="The NarraLume writing studio with manuscript, prose, and review tools" width="1440"></p>

### Story bible

Seven sections keep author intent, outline, entities, canon, relationships, timeline events, and foreshadowing separate but available to the same writing workflow. The editing panel can save a direct change or stage an AI suggestion for the author to review first.

<p><img src="assets/narralume-bible-1920x1080.png" alt="The seven-section story bible" width="1440"></p>

### Project assistant

The assistant stays beside the current project and understands the page or selection already in view, so the author does not have to reconstruct context in every message. It can explain, locate work, and propose actions, while persistent changes still wait for confirmation.

<p><img src="assets/narralume-assistant-1920x1080.png" alt="The context-aware project assistant sidebar" width="1440"></p>

### AI quick creation

Quick creation is a three-step workflow for preparing a direction, confirming boundaries, and producing chapters. The author can pause, steer, review chapter by chapter, and resolve canon conflicts before the task continues.

<p><img src="assets/narralume-autopilot-1920x1080.png" alt="The AI quick creation workspace" width="1440"></p>

### Delivery

Delivery brings quality reminders, common export formats, and project snapshots into one place. The checks point out unfinished work without pretending to decide whether the manuscript is ready.

## Three ways to write

| Mode               | When it fits                                                                                               | What remains under author control                                                        |
| ------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Fully manual       | The plan is already clear, or the manuscript should not pass through a model                               | All prose, versions, story material, exports, and backups                                |
| Focused assistance | A passage needs editing, a scene needs options, a chapter needs review, or one chapter should be delegated | Selection, instruction, candidate acceptance, and story-change decisions                 |
| Continuous writing | The direction is confirmed and several chapters should move forward in one run                             | Boundaries, chapter target, pause and steering, chapter results, and conflict resolution |

All three modes use the same manuscript versions and canon. Switching modes does not create incompatible copies of the project.

## Choose an entry point

| Audience               | Entry point                                        | Prerequisites                                            | Default data location                           |
| ---------------------- | -------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| First-time visitor     | [Hosted demo](https://app.narralume.me/)           | A modern browser with OPFS and Web Worker support        | The current site's browser OPFS                 |

| Public-demo maintainer | [Cloud deployment guide](docs/deploy-cloud.en.md)  | Wrangler, domains, upstream model, and a security policy | Advanced path; most users do not need Bridge    |

### A ten-minute first workflow

1. Start ChapterFlow and open the作品库. Local release users can run the platform launcher for their environment.
2. Create a blank book and enter a title and premise. Model configuration can wait.
3. Open Story, write the author intent, and create one chapter outline. Characters and facts can be added as the draft grows.
4. Create a chapter in the writing studio, enter text, and save a new version.
5. Open Delivery, confirm that the project exports, and create a project snapshot.

After that path works, add model configuration, review, or continuous creation as needed. The detailed [user guide](docs/user-guide.en.md), [quick start](docs/quick-start.en.md), and the rest of the product documentation are available in both Chinese and English.

## Import, export, and recovery

| Object                     | Format or scope                                                                   | Intended use                                                                               |
| -------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Manuscript import          | Markdown, plain text, DOCX, HTML, EPUB, NarraLume project bundle                  | Analyze existing work into candidates before applying it to a project                      |
| Reading and editing export | Markdown, plain text, DOCX, EPUB                                                  | Submission, layout work, or reading in another tool                                        |
| Project bundle             | One book and its author-visible material                                          | Move a project between NarraLume environments without model credentials                    |
| Project snapshot           | Story material, manuscript versions, comments, reviews, and collaboration history | Restore a new project inside the current library without overwriting the original          |
| Full SQLite backup         | The entire library and local settings                                             | Upgrade, migration, and disaster recovery; may contain locally stored provider credentials |

These objects are not cloud sync and are not interchangeable. Read [Data, privacy, and backup](docs/data-and-backup.en.md) before placing real work in any mode.

## Models and data

Configure AI by creating a provider channel, registering its upstream model, and assigning that model to the default generation role. Planning and review inherit the default unless explicitly overridden; embeddings are configured separately for semantic search.

NarraLume supports OpenAI Chat Completions, OpenAI Responses, and Anthropic Messages. Direct browser requests require the provider to allow the current origin through CORS; the local Server does not have that browser restriction. See [Configuration](docs/configuration.en.md).

Bridge and Relay are only for maintainers running a public demo with a private or local upstream. Most users can skip them and use the hosted browser kernel, local Server, or Docker directly.

| Runtime                       | Work and run history                           | Important boundary                                                                                 |
| ----------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Hosted demo / browser kernel  | Site-scoped OPFS SQLite in the current browser | Clearing site data, using private browsing, or changing browsers may make the library inaccessible |
| Local launcher / local Server | `data/narralume.sqlite` by default             | Do not copy the live database directly; use backup features or scripts                             |
| Docker Compose                | The `narralume-data` volume                    | `docker compose down --volumes` deletes the volume; keep backups on an independent host path       |

Browser, local Server, and Docker libraries do not synchronize automatically. A downloaded full library may contain bring-your-own provider credentials and should be protected like the manuscript and API keys.

## Who it is for

NarraLume fits authors who expect to maintain a book over time, care about continuity, want manual writing to remain primary, or prefer to choose their own models and data location.

It is not currently a real-time multi-user document or an account-based cloud sync service. A general chat tool is simpler for a one-off question; NarraLume becomes useful when the outline, versions, canon changes, and long-running tasks need to remain connected.

## Development

```bash
npm ci
npm run dev
```

The development Web app listens on `http://127.0.0.1:4318`; the Server/API listens on `http://127.0.0.1:4317`.

| Command                                       | Purpose                                                                                                |
| --------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `npm run verify`                              | Run formatting, linting, type checks, tests, evidence checks, license checks, and the production build |
| `npm run test:e2e`                            | Exercise cross-page and responsive workflows with Playwright                                           |
| `npm run release:build`                       | Build the release archive for the current supported platform                                           |
| `npm run deploy:web` / `npm run deploy:relay` | Preview or deploy your own Cloudflare Web and Relay                                                    |

The repository is split by responsibility: `apps/web` contains the UI and browser kernel, `apps/server` contains the local API and backup service, `packages/` contains domain, task, persistence, and shared contracts, and `deploy/` plus `scripts/` handle delivery and operations.

## Common questions

- **Can it work without a model?** Yes. Books, story material, outlines, manual writing, versions, comments, imports, exports, and backups remain available.
- **Why can a provider fail in the browser?** Check the protocol, Base URL, key, and CORS. An upstream that cannot allow browser CORS can be reached through the local Server.
- **Why is a book missing after an upgrade?** Confirm that the new instance points to the original data directory. Do not replace an existing `data/` directory with an empty one.
- **Can AI overwrite the manuscript?** Generated prose, revisions, and story changes pass through candidate and acceptance steps. Destructive operations are not completed by a chat instruction alone.
- **Can it be exposed publicly?** It can be self-hosted, but remote access requires a high-entropy token, TLS, access control, and independent backups. Do not expose the local Server directly.
